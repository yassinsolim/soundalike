This document is the story behind the code: the problem, the constraints, the design
decisions, the walls I hit, and how I got through them. The polished "what it is and how to
run it" lives in the [README](../README.md); this is the "how it was built and why."

## TL;DR

- **Started with:** a ~180-line first-year terminal script that read a static CSV of songs and
  printed min/max/mean statistics.
- **Ended with:** an installable Python package with **four recommendation engines**, a live
  Spotify integration (OAuth PKCE, no passwords), and a **self-supervised audio-embedding neural
  network** trained on the GPU.
- **Headline result:** the learned model's genre-probe accuracy scales with data —
  **0.25 → 0.601 → 0.641** as the training set grows **475 → 25,000 → 106,000** tracks — going
  from *losing* to a no-ML baseline to beating it by **+13 points**.
- **Built and validated on:** an NVIDIA RTX 5080 (Blackwell), 49 automated tests, a clean
  packaged wheel.

## 1. The problem

The original project (`spotify_program.py`) was a good learning exercise but fundamentally
limited: it read one static 855-row CSV and computed aggregate statistics. The goal was to turn
it into something real — **a tool that finds songs that genuinely sound like the ones you
like**, better than the mediocre "song radio" features that already exist.

### The constraint that shaped everything

The obvious approach — ask Spotify's API for similar songs and audio features — is **no longer
possible**. On **2024-11-27, Spotify removed** the Recommendations and Audio Features endpoints
for all new apps ([official announcement](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api)).
Those are exactly the endpoints this idea would normally depend on.

That constraint became the project's defining design driver: **if you can't get similarity or
audio features from Spotify, you have to compute them yourself.** That's not a limitation — it's
the whole point of what makes this interesting.

## 2. Architecture: four engines, one idea

Every engine answers the same question — "what sounds like this?" — but from a different signal
and with different tradeoffs.

| Engine | Signal | Credentials | Coverage |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Content-based** | Audio-feature vectors, standardized + weighted | None | Bundled dataset |
| **Acoustic DSP** | Features measured from the raw waveform (librosa) | None | Any track with a preview |
| **Learned model** | A CNN trained to embed audio (contrastive) | None | Whatever it's trained on |
| **Live Spotify / Last.fm** | Your real listening + optional crowd data | Free API keys | Your library / any track |

A deliberate design principle runs through the two flagship engines: **ranking is done purely by
the sound.** A music catalog (Deezer) is used *only* to enumerate candidate songs and fetch their
audio — never to decide what's "similar." That keeps the recommendations grounded in acoustics
rather than "people who listened to X also listened to Y," which is what every existing tool
already does.

---

## 3. The machine-learning story (the interesting part)

The most ambitious engine trains a neural network to place similar-sounding songs near each
other in an embedding space. It's **self-supervised** using a contrastive objective (NT-Xent,
the SimCLR loss): two augmented snippets of the *same* track are pulled together while snippets
of *different* tracks are pushed apart. This needs **no similarity labels** — which is essential,
because nobody hands you ground-truth "these two songs are similar" data.

### Act 1 — an honest failure

The first attempt trained on ~475 songs harvested from free previews. The result was humbling
and instructive: **the neural network lost to a trivial baseline.** A no-learning approach
(mean+std pooling of the spectrogram) recovered genre at **0.375** accuracy; the neural net
managed only **0.25** — barely above the **0.24** chance rate.

This is textbook behaviour: **contrastive deep learning is data-hungry.** With only a few
hundred examples the model can tell individual clips apart without ever learning what makes a
*genre* cohere. Rather than hide this, I measured it explicitly and treated it as the signal to
scale up. (I also confirmed genres *were* separable from audio — the baseline's 0.375 ≫ 0.24
chance proved the signal existed; the model just needed more data to capture it.)

### Act 2 — scaling to real data

The [Free Music Archive](https://github.com/mdeff/fma) provides labeled audio at scale. I trained
on FMA-medium (25k tracks) and then FMA-large (106k tracks), evaluating with a **kNN genre
probe** — freeze the embeddings, then see how well a simple classifier recovers genre from them.
A model that has learned real musical structure will score well above chance.

| Training data | Neural kNN | No-ML baseline | Chance | Verdict |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|--------|---------|
| 475 tracks | 0.25 | 0.375 | 0.24 | **loses** to baseline |
| FMA-medium 25,000 | 0.601 | 0.521 | 0.28 | **+8 points** |
| FMA-large 106,000 | **0.641** | 0.507 | 0.29 | **+13 points** |

**The scaling curve is the whole story.** The more data, the wider the neural network's margin
over the baseline — precisely what the theory predicts. At 106k tracks, **57% of songs have a
same-genre nearest neighbor** in the learned space, from a model that never saw a single label
during training.

![FMA-large results](fma_large_results.png)

*Training on 106k tracks: loss falls as the genre-probe accuracy rises (left); the embedding
space forms visible clusters — Electronic at top, Rock/Pop at bottom, a tight Old-Time/Historic
island (middle); per-genre nearest-neighbor retrieval reaches Old-Time 93%, Rock 74%, Classical
67%, Hip-Hop 64% (right).*

### Does it actually recommend well?

The numbers are backed up by qualitative results. Querying the 106k model with mainstream songs
it has never seen (it maps them into the learned space and finds neighbors in the FMA catalog):

- **"Lose Yourself" — Eminem** → 5 of 6 neighbors are labeled **Hip-Hop**.
- **"Clair de Lune" — Debussy** → a Beethoven piano sonata (**Classical**) and other solo-piano
  instrumental tracks.
- **"Bohemian Rhapsody" — Queen** → folk/acoustic ballad tracks, matching its ballad sections.

The model learned to discriminate by acoustic character — rap finds rap, classical finds
classical — purely from the physics of the audio.

## 4. Engineering challenges (and how I solved them)

The interesting problems weren't the ML — they were the systems engineering around it.

### Challenge: the GPU was starving

The first FMA-medium training run pinned the GPU at **9% utilization**. Sampling `nvidia-smi`
over time showed a sawtooth: brief bursts to 98% then long stalls — a classic data-loading
bottleneck. The root cause was random reads of 25,000 tiny spectrogram files from a slow
network-mounted drive (measured at ~20 files/second).

**Fix:** I built a consolidation step (`pack.py`) that packs every spectrogram into a single
compact `float16` array, and a training path (`train_fast.py`) that loads the **entire dataset
into VRAM once** and does augmentation *on the GPU*. Result: **99% utilization, 37s/epoch** — the
bottleneck vanished.

### Challenge: the dataset didn't fit in VRAM

Scaling to 106k tracks made the packed dataset **14 GB** — too big to sit in the 5080's 16 GB
VRAM alongside the model. Rather than fail or shrink the data, I made the trainer **auto-detect
its data residency**: it keeps the dataset GPU-resident when it fits (FMA-medium) and switches to
**pinned CPU RAM with per-batch PCIe streaming** when it doesn't (FMA-large). A batch is only
~17 MB, so the transfer overlaps compute and the GPU still runs at **99% utilization**.

### Challenge: downloading 93 GB

FMA-large is a 93 GB archive. A single-stream download ran at ~13 MB/s (~2 hours). I switched to
**aria2 with 16 parallel connections**, hitting **~138 MB/s — an ~11x speedup** (~11 minutes).
Along the way I also had to diagnose and recover from a corrupted download (two writers hitting
the same file) and abandon a problematic drive that blocked executable launches.

### Challenge: understanding the hardware

Out of genuine curiosity about how NVIDIA's libraries pick low-level algorithms, I built a
**cuDNN solver-selection inspector** (`ml/gpu.py`). It surfaces which CUDA kernel cuDNN chooses
for a given convolution — revealing it selected a **TF32 Tensor-Core `cutlass` kernel in NHWC
layout**, plus the layout-transpose kernels that overhead implies. I then demonstrated the
optimization ladder empirically: **NCHW → channels-last (1.34x) → fp16 + channels-last (4.2x)**,
and folded channels-last + mixed precision into training so the 5080 runs near its Tensor-Core
peak.

## 5. Security & correctness

- **No passwords, ever.** Live Spotify access uses OAuth 2.0 **Authorization Code + PKCE** with a
  local loopback callback, CSRF `state` validation, and cached auto-refreshing tokens.
- **No secrets in git.** Credentials live only in a git-ignored `.env`; the repo ships a
  `.env.example` template.
- **No data leakage in evaluation.** The encoder trains self-supervised on the train split only;
  the kNN probe splits *within* validation and *within* test, never crossing into the training
  set. This was independently verified in code review.
- **49 automated tests** cover the recommenders, OAuth/PKCE, the DSP engine, and the ML pipeline
  (including the augmentation, contrastive loss, and dataset-split logic).

---

## 6. What I'd build next

- **Persist a personal acoustic-feature store** so the engines cover a user's entire Spotify
  library, not just what's in a preview catalog.
- **Hybrid ranking** that blends the learned embedding with the hand-crafted DSP features.
- **Human-in-the-loop evaluation** — let a user rate recommendations to measure real-world
  quality beyond the genre proxy.
- **FMA-large with a larger encoder** and longer training, now that the pipeline scales.

## 7. Skills demonstrated

For anyone evaluating this as a portfolio piece, the work spans:

- **Machine learning:** self-supervised contrastive learning (SimCLR/NT-Xent), CNN and ResNet
  encoders, mixed-precision training, embedding evaluation (kNN probe, silhouette, retrieval),
  UMAP visualization — with an honest, measured account of when deep learning does and doesn't
  help.
- **Digital signal processing:** mel-spectrograms, MFCC/timbre features, tempo and spectral
  analysis from raw audio.
- **GPU / systems performance:** diagnosing data-loading bottlenecks, VRAM-aware data residency,
  CUDA memory-layout and precision tuning, reading cuDNN kernel selection.
- **API integration & security:** OAuth 2.0 PKCE, token lifecycle management, rate-limit handling,
  secret hygiene.
- **Software engineering:** clean package design, a 49-test suite, packaging, a documented CLI,
  and a reviewed, merged pull request.
- **Data engineering:** multi-connection downloading, parallel preprocessing across CPU cores,
  compact on-disk formats, robust handling of corrupt inputs.
